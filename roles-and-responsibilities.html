    <h1>The Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h1>

    <p>The three main roles in the SDLC are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The PO (product owner)</b><br>This is a business representative or a voice for the stakeholders. Another name for the PO is the requirement owner, as they make sure that development is done in accordance with the project requirements.</li>
        <li><b>The PM (project manager)</b><br>This can be considered a team representative. The PM's task is to coordinate the work of the participants and organize meetings and negotiations.</li>
        <li><b>The TL (team lead)</b>This role focuses on technical implementation and advises on how to translate initial ideas into technical solutions. They also monitor the architectural logic of the product and solve other technical issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Product Owner (PO)</h2>
    <p>The main responsibilities of the PO are to set the direction and prioritise. Since he or she represents the stakeholders, the PO must clearly communicate their interests to the development team.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Expertise in the business domain;</li>
        <li>A strong understanding of the product, its requirements and objectives;</li>
        <li>The ability to remain fully involved in the process;</li>
        <li>Competence in making decisions about prioritizing, accepting work, and identifying important features;</li>
        <li>The ability to communicate decisions to the main decision-maker (if it’s not the PO themselves);</li>
        <li>The ability to convey information to the team (i.e., the ability to create good User Stories);</li>
        <li>Knowledge of how to communicate new requirements and keep old ones up to date;</li>
        <li>A vision for the future.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Manager (PM)</h2>
    <p>As an integral part of the team, the PM organizes the smooth operation of all processes and ensures there’s clear and open communication between the business and the vendor. As the person who monitors development progress and resources, the PM will have to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plan time and tasks for the preparation of versions and releases according to the Project Roadmap</li>
        <li>Manage development iterations;</li>
        <li>Coach and sync the development team;</li>
        <li>Report on time/efforts and the delivered features;</li>
        <li>Ensure efficient communication between the team and the Product Owner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Team Lead (TL)</h2>
    <p>It's up to you to decide who is “mom” and who is “dad” on the project, but the PM and TL are really like parents in the sense that they provide the team with everything they need to develop, including requirements, priorities, context, and solutions. Just keep in mind that a TL is appointed exclusively by the vendor because they need to be trusted by the team.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Projecting the right architectural solution;</li>
        <li>Monitoring how the solution is being implemented;</li>
        <li>Communicating with the PO;</li>
        <li>Helping make the right decision if there is a dispute (concerning technical solutions);</li>
        <li>Helping to validate the roadmap (concerning the possibility and advisability of choosing this or that solution).</li>
    </ul>
