	    <p>The main roles in the SDLC are:</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li><b>The PO (product owner)</b><br>This is a business representative or a voice for the stakeholders. Another name for the PO is the requirement owner, as they make sure that development is done in accordance with the project requirements.</li>
	        <li><b>The PM (project manager)</b><br>This can be considered a team representative. The PM's task is to coordinate the work of the participants and organize meetings and negotiations.</li>
	        <li><b>The TL (team lead)</b>This role focuses on technical implementation and advises on how to translate initial ideas into technical solutions. They also monitor the architectural logic of the product and solve other technical issues.</li>        <li><b>The SD (software developer)</b><br>This is the role that will build the designed system. Creating all the functionality and libraries.</li>        
	        <li><b>The ST (software tester)</b><br>The Software tester is involved in the quality assurance stage of software development and deployment</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Product Owner (PO)</h2>
	    <p>The main responsibilities of the PO are to set the direction and prioritise. Since he or she represents the stakeholders, the PO must clearly communicate their interests to the development team.</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Expertise in the business domain;</li>
	        <li>A strong understanding of the product, its requirements and objectives;</li>

	        <li>Competence in making decisions about prioritizing, accepting work, and identifying important features;</li>
	        <li>The ability to communicate decisions to the main decision-maker (if it’s not the PO themselves);</li>
	        <li>The ability to convey information to the team (i.e., the ability to create good User Stories);</li>
	        <li>Knowledge of how to communicate new requirements and keep old ones up to date;</li>

	    </ul>

	    <h2>Team Lead (TL)</h2>
	    <p>It's up to you to decide who is “mom” and who is “dad” on the project, but the PM and TL are really like parents in the sense that they provide the team with everything they need to develop, including requirements, priorities, context, and solutions. Just keep in mind that a TL is appointed exclusively by the vendor because they need to be trusted by the team.</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Projecting the right architectural solution;</li>
	        <li>Monitoring how the solution is being implemented;</li>
	        <li>Communicating with the PO;</li>
	        <li>Helping make the right decision if there is a dispute (concerning technical solutions);</li>
	        <li>Helping to validate the roadmap (concerning the possibility and advisability of choosing this or that solution).</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Software Developer (SD)</h2>
	    <p>The role of a software developer engages in identifying, designing, installing and testing a software system they have built for a company from the ground up. It can range from creating internal programmes that can help businesses be more efficient to producing systems that can be sold on the open market. Once software developers have delivered the final software system, they will also help in maintaining and updating the programme to ensure that all security problems are fixed, and it operates with new databases. In a role of a software developer they create the applications that allow people to do specific tasks on a computer or mobile and others develop the underlying systems that control networks.</p>
	    <p>There are a variety of skills you are required to have as a software developer, but these skills can vary across jobs. Here are some of the skills that the majority of employers look for in a software developer:</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li>Ability to use more than one development language</li>
	    	<li>Design, test and develop software to meet user needs</li>
	    	<li>Critical thinking</li>
	    	<li>Keen attention to detail</li>
	    	<li>Write and maintain software</li>
	    	<li>Strong problem solver</li>
	    	<li>Create complex databases for organisations</li>
	    	<li>Document application process for future maintenance and upgrades</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>The responsibilties of a developer include:</p>
