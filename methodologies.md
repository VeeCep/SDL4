## Agile Programming

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

## Waterfall Programming

The waterfall methodology uses a sequential or linear approach to software development. The project is broken down into a sequence of tasks, with the highest level grouping referred to as phases.
