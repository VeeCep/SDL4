        <h3>Requirement Analysis</h3>
        <p>Outlining client expectations, deciding on a minimal viable product. This involves determining the intended userbase, how they will use it and what requirements this will entail.</p>
        <h3>Desgin</h3>
        <p>Once requirements have been determined, developers must decide on how the project will progress. For instance, technical requirements will determine what languages and frameworks are used, along with database design, and security concerns after risk analysis. Functional specifications will be decided on in order to reach a MVP, while non-functional specifications will be concerned with extensibility.</p>
        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>The actual programming begins in this phase, although this maybe carried out in alternative ways depending on chosen development methodologies and whether unit testing will take place. This is usually the longest phase, as requirements may change as the product is prototyped for the client, and potentially unforeseen issues arrise.</p>
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>While unit testing might be employed in the previous stage to guide programming, this stage may involve more indepth testing methods. For instance, functional tests may take place for specific client requirements, while integration tests will determine the efficacy of connected modules of the product. There are many types of testing, with some being more expensive/intensive than others (sometimes dependent on whether they can be automated or not).</p>
        <h3>Deployment and maintenance</h3>
        <p>Products may be deployed in a variety of ways dependent on size and complexity. Often modules or test versions will be deployed prior to a full release, and often to a sample size of the intended userbase. During this stage, any issues not found found by earlier testing, discussion about design and limitations, or through programming itself will be caught and solved.</p>
